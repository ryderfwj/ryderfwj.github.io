          Rewatching this, I can say it's just as good as I remembered it. The show can it's characters didn't lose it's
          charm at all
          after all the time has passed. How the story is split up is also pretty easy to follow, working on Exodus and
          working on 3rd Girls' Fighter Wing.
          I like how each project has the same problem that need to be resolved but the underlying cause of it can be
          very different.
          Exodus' problem lies in the director's slow storyboarding due to him being unable to find a satisfying ending
          sequence in the set production time,
          while 3GFW's problem is with the author himself rejecting particulars of the anime.

          Granted there are some other factors like the hand drawn vs CG clash, poor communication for both Tarou during
          the clash mentioned and
          Mr "Funny Thing" throughout the entire 3GFW. Hell, I'd argue it's 90% that guy's fault, with some problems
          regarding the outsourced work and Hiraoka. But for the most part,
          the production team isn't worried whether they can resolve it, they are more worried if they can resolve it on
          time. The deadline is always mentioned
          for every problem they face.

          And with these problems is how they tie it to the characters of the show. The cast is huge, but the slowly
          introduce them
          as needed when a task or a problem requires their attention. And I like ho it's not instantly resolved most of
          the time, they always need to come back to
          the character at another time which also gives them more screen time. Like how they needed to go back and
          forth to get Endou back to do the explosion scene,
          the meeting with Atsumi to get his help on the cloud background art and Iguchi on her character designs. It's
          a really good way to both see what the
          characters do in terms of their jobs, the struggles they face whether it be technical or personal reasons and
          to move things around so stuff
          does get stale. It lacks the depth that other anime does such as only focusing on the art aspects with few
          mentions on other aspects of the production,
          but it gives a better overall look on the production, I think.

          And the character at so cute, well, the cute ones that is. The main 5 or rather 3 or 4 depending on who you
          ask, are a joy to watch as they need
          to deal with the problems of their job, seeing them make hard choices, struggle and sometimes fail on it but
          never giving up and helping each other whenever they can.
          I could say the show revolves around Miyamori, and I guess it kinda does, but to say she alone make everything
          great would be false. Her interactions with everyone
          and how those people interact with everyone else makes the show as great as it is. The voices are great too,
          from the VAs that matches their appearance, to everyone else involved,
          everyone sounds like they are supposed to.

          The choice to focus on Miyamori is understandable as she is the production manager <s>for half the runtime
            anyways</s> and it allows us to meet everyone as we follow her.
          I like how her starting out as Production Assistant always had her panicking so much, even her juniors panic
          less than her in the latter half of the show.

        But she's reliable and gets the job done despite all the shit thrown at her, she's very organized and focused,
        but is also easily pulled into things and starts stressing out,
        but her positive attitude and with some help from her colleagues helps mitigate that and put her back on track.
        For her part, the moment I love the most was when her mom as calling over and saw her name in the credits,
        it was such a wholesome moment and nearing the end when Zuka got a part in 3GFW and they finally made an anime
        together, damn ninjas.

        Ema being shy and quiet for the first half and being more proactive later on is a good change, her helping Ai
        probably also boosted her confidence. And her dance, I mean,
        this was before that one became cool, and this is way cuter.

        But beyond that, her struggles with her low paying job is too real in he anime industry.
        And seeing her drop quality for quantity and seeing her get criticized for it just makes me sad but it was
        deserved, how she bounced back was cute involving nekos, so that's nice.
        It also helps having a good senior by your side too. Animators don't take criticism that well huh? But she
        manage to swallow that humiliation and improve upon that.
        Just like how goth loli said so later on in the series for Iguchi's case, so nice call back I guess.

        Zuka suffering was such a pain to watch, you'd normally think, being part of the mc group she'll land the job no
        mater what.
        Well this aint fucking shounen anime who cares about your feels and the industry rightfully rejected her so
        much. And every time they have a meetup and they start talking about
        their work, it's just so painful.

        Some of her mess up are pretty cute though, like the no shoes one.
        But seeing her do other things like the play and the mascot event and slowly improving it really nice. And
        although she did get a pretty
        nice end to it, it shows that hardwork won't guarantee success all the time.

        Misa I think didn't have enough focus on the latter half of the show. The first half has her struggle between a
        stable job vs her dream, but that was quickly
        resolved. Still seeing her go into detail about wheels shows how much she as into her job previously and how
        much she learned from it. Showing there's no job
        where you don't get something out of it at least.

        Midori didn't do much on the first half so I guess she's the opposite, but she's still a student I think.
        Har participation in the latter half is fun as heck, seeing her go into detail of her research and actually
        showing curiosity on the topic at hand is just
        a fun thing to watch and her being mentored by Maitake shows some progress on her part of being a good writer
        someday.

        And the character designs of this show is just great, I am not able to remember their all names, and I'm sure
        most people don't either. But each
        design is unique enough that once introduced to their role, I can remember which character does what in a show,
        and for a cast of over 20 that's really fucking
        impressive on the design part. And most of them isn't some washboard 1 dimensional stereotype, with some very
        minor character exceptions they are all
        complex and multifaceted.

        This is an absolute must watch if you're a few years into anime and call yourself an anime fan, but if you are
        reading this, then you already did.
        <s>Unless you're the kind of person who skip large segments or watch at faster speeds then fuck u</s> But really
        now, Shirobako is perhaps my top anime of all time
        and for good reason. It showcases the medium I love and enjoy so much, and although it's definitely in a rose
        coloured way, it manages to makes thing tense
        enough that you feel for the characters in the show. It's also about adulthood and achieving your dreams, the
        struggles you'll face when you get there, and sometimes
        the harshness of reality itself. The cast is so large and varied, you'll absolutely find someone to relate to.
        Whether you're trying to be edgy, or whether
        something you put everything into gets criticized or you fail it, whether you need to deal with deadlines and
        the incompetence of other, or whether you just
        enjoy a nice donut, those are just a few I can list out.

        So the verdict, did I like watching this show or OF COURSE I FUCKING LIKE WATCHING IT. Watching it a second time
        around made me appreciate more
        how anime is made, whether good or bad. And I realize how some small aspect that seems easy at first can be such
        a big hassle when you're actually doing it.
        So here I would like to thank all the people who made this rewatch possible and a joy to watch. From the club
        staff that manages the club, to encoding the vids and uploading
        them to the "sekrit" vaults, to our cytube wizard for making such a good interface to watch it on, to all the
        peeps who joined and made the sessions as fun and
        as enjoyable as possible. Thank you!
