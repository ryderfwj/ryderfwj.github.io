          First thing first, this is my first time watching Steins;Gate to completion.
          But it isn't my first time watching it, I've dropped by 7 to 8 times in 2018,
          and another 15 more probably before it was picked. All of which wasn't because of the show,
          just that I was stuck at around episode 6 to 8, then something would come up and I would
          never return to the show. This time was no different, I had real life things to deal with
          and I thought I wasn't going to finish it this time either. But heck, I decided to watch
          something else and from it, remembered something important. So here I am, finally finishing what
          a lot of people would say is the top 10 if not at least top 50 anime of all time.

          And since I've been through a lot lately, I thought I come out to say this, I have no idea
          who you are, but your words hurt me back then . And since you've stopped harassing me for 
          sometime now I can only guess you've moved on or isn't on the server anymore. But if you are 
          still here, I hope we can get along.

          For every show, I will mention characterization, because that's the very basic ingredient
          for me to enjoy a show. Some shows have only 1 or 2 characters that a fleshed out and can truly
          be considered good, and that's okay, it's enough for me to enjoy the show even if the rest isn't
          great. Some shows have good characterization for the most of the cast involved, but none that are fantastic,
          still good enough for me to enjoy as long as variety is kept. And then there are ones that can have
          a decently sized cast, not 50 characters per say, more like 8 to 20 and still manage have fantastic
          characterization for more than half of them and good one for the rest. And I can say without a doubt,
          Steins;Gate is now one of them that I can put in high regards for great characterization with a decently,
          sized cast. To put into perspective, I only have 7 other shows that I have in that category to which,
          I will reveal 2, FMAB and Shirobako, so yes, Steins;Gate definitely impressed me on the character part.

          And they did it in a way that makes sense, and still enjoyed similarly like the rest.
          Due to everyone being reset constantly by the D-mail and Time-leap, character growth was
          practically limited to Okabe only, other than the rarely memory fragments that may or may
          not influence the characters in the current timeline. So, every character other than Okabe
          will need to pull their stuff more than him for me to be invested in them. And they did,
          all of them have an established type from the moment I saw them, but the show doesnt reveal
          the rest of their details until later on, kind of like a delayed introduction. And that's fine,
          I was spending a lot of time being distracted by time-machine stuff after all. But when it does come,
          the story can use different versions of the characters, the ones before and the ones after, which only
          adds to the characterization, seeing how they may change based on certain events.

          The characterization style makes sense and is done properly without breaking the original mold too much.
          Mayuri being an airhead whenever Okabe, Kurisu and Daru talk about science stuff, but is super caring and
          attentive, which lead her to figure out who was Suzuha's father was, and Kurisu even mentioned it a few 
          episodes before that, Mayuri observed more things in the lab than they do. Daru being a Super 
          <s>haker</s> Hacker, loving his 2D waifus, is uh... totally relatable but that's besides the point. 
          I always thought why would he hang out with Okabe when occasionally he gets shafted so hard by Okabe, 
          but then the later episodes show Okabe is very caring for his lab members and there's probably another 
          side to their story I haven't seen fleshed out. Not to mention, Daru himself is also a nice person, 
          when that time he tried to fake the pin badge creation without much motivation other than perhaps pity 
          and friendship with Suzuha to which at that point, I can see why he still sticks with Okabe. It is
          these little things I noticed that made my watch even more enjoyable and fun.

          And there's no way I can skip these 2 when talk about characters. So, ladies first. Let's get this out of the
          way, Kurisu best girl, there. Next, Kurisu's characterization is damn well done, her base character as a 
          genius scientist who focuses on time is and never was broken. And slowly the show added more piece of her, 
          starting with being a Tsundere being the biggest one I see from the start <s>So this is where Poes got 
          her tsundere side from</s>. Aside from that, the show eventually added more pieces into her character, 
          from her enjoying the lab environment more, to her wanting recognition from her father,
          it's not character growth per say, since it was already there from the begining, still it has the same 
          impact as a great one, which pushes her into a great character. Okabe on the other is the true and 
          told person with any character development that I am used to. From start to finish it is still the same 
          Okabe just with more and more memories being added. Seeing him go from a total nutjob mad scientist 
          that can easily get flustered when confronted, to total doomer mode in the last few episode can be 
          pretty heart breaking but realistically relatable at times. After all, people will break down eventually 
          when going through those kind of events <s>insert creepy gigguk noises</s>. But what he did, was not for naught, 
          all those times spent, all those efforts put in, all those words spoken, and all the friendship he made 
          eventually all came back to him when he needed it, especially that slap. Everything he did, he had
          help all along the way, from Kurisu's knowledge and time planning, to Daru's knowledge of electronics, 
          to Suzuha getting them the IBN, to Mayuri's... uh... emotional support and slap??? He had it all the time 
          in every single timeline to help him achieve the ending or rather, the begining he wanted. 
          And in a way because of him, the characterization of the other characters in other timeline 
          still lives on with him, which makes him more progressively interesting to watch, as time passed on.

          Now for the other bits, the story and plot itself was great, it's been ages since I saw a time traveling
          stuff, and even longer with this complex of an explanation. And if you're wondering, it was Warcraft, 
          not the best example but close enough. Back to the story, I gotta say they did a great job at keeping 
          things to pace, I was rarely if ever overwhelmed by the timelines confusion and things changing 
          differently, though I heard this was suppoed to be one of the defining traits that makes you watch again 
          to understand it. I found little problems in keeping up, maybe due to my history of watching shows with 
          timeskips and back and forth story telling. The time travelling aspect maybe it's greastest strength 
          and weakness to the show I think, if you can keep up, dang you'll need to rewatch a lot of it or 
          you'll only understand half of the things and proably hate the show. But I was fortunately not in that 
          ballpark, so it went smoothly in terms of story, plot and the mysteries. Even the one that didnt get 
          explained directly, like the D-mail delaying Mayuri's death by a day was decently easy to come to a 
          conclusion, either that was supposed to happen in each timeline or Sern just had less information 
          due to the alert not triggering as often until no D-mail was sent at all. Though there are problems 
          with that theory so I might be wrong either way. As for the rest of the story, I find the chill 
          moments to be the best, where everyone isn't in mortal danger, but had a goal to move towards which 
          allows the characters to shine.

          Now for the last 2, art and music. I gotta be honest, the art is alright. Not fantastic, but it definitely
          fits the show, isn't jarring and gets the job done, Color palete is pretty washed out with a lot of white 
          and brown but it adds to the show's atmosphere especially when used during the more depressing scenes of 
          the show. And the usage of both the rain and sunset for those important scenes was great, one during the 
          bad timeline and one during the good one. It's like the prequels, its poetry and I don't like sand. 
          The music is great, love the OP song itself, and was surprised they changed it on episode 23, 
          a bit sad they kept the same visuals but animating a new opening for the last 2 episodes is a bit 
          unrealistic anyways so not of great concern, at least they kept "Hacking to the Gate". 
          The ED is fine, but the cool one is episode 22 ED, glad that I actually stick with the ED.

          I would say, this has been a splendid watched. I can definitely see why this is praised so highly at the time.
          And why it is still recommended just as much right now. My overall enjoyment of the show was high and this is
          easily on of the top anime I've watched in recent times. So thank you, Poes, for picking Steins;Gate. 10/10.
