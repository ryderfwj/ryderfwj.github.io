        The characters are fun, engaging, memorable in the show's sense and have a different side to them
        Ozu seriously looks like an garlic bulb with shark teeth, but has a loving side with Kohinata revealed
        at the end. Akashi being super cold to everyone but mc, and panics when a she see's a moth. Jougasaki
        looks like your generic handsome popular guy but has some nasty weird secrets. Ryuoko the mature pretty
        dentist lady that has a licking problem when drunk. I like how everyone has this side to em that some
        are shown early on while others are slowly expanded as each episode progresses.

        By the 3rd episode me and everyone's grandma can see how this show will play out, keep rewinding back
        and repeat the whole process again with slightly different conditions. They still keep some minor things
        consistent, like how Ozu looks like an onion bulb, Akashi being in the engineering department and 
        <s>hates</s> is midly inconvenienced by moths. I like how each episode introduced a new character or
        factions and gradually uses those new characters in order to differ each episode, whether by expanding
        the background of said character/faction or putting the mc in those positions like with the secret society.

        For the OP, I like how they can show all the characters without actually spoiling
        much of anythingFor the final episode I love how they swapped the ED and OP positions
