        The characters are fun, engaging, memorable in the show's sense and have a different side to them
        Ozu seriously looks like an garlic bulb with shark teeth, but has a loving side with Kohinata revealed
        at the end. Akashi being super cold to everyone but mc, and panics when a she see's a moth. Jougasaki
        looks like your generic handsome popular guy but has some nasty weird secrets. Ryuoko the mature pretty
        dentist lady that has a licking problem when drunk. I like how everyone has this side to em that some
        are shown early on while others are slowly expanded as each episode progresses.

        By the 3rd episode me and everyone's grandma can see how this show will play out, keep rewinding back
        and repeat the whole process again with slightly different conditions. They still keep some minor things
        consistent, like how Ozu looks like an onion bulb, Akashi being in the engineering department and 
        <s>hates</s> is midly inconvenienced by moths. I like how each episode introduced a new character or
        factions and gradually uses those new characters in order to differ each episode, whether by expanding
        the background of said character/faction or putting the mc in those positions like with the secret society.

        The story is certainly interesting. Repeating the same start with different choices that ultimate lead to an end
        where the MC just wishes to rewind every single time. It's sorta predictable but also adds enough variety
        in between all of it to make me think how this will play out differently. And I like how each time the cost of 
        the fortune teller increases, as if saying its going to cost the MC more the longer the MC does not get his 
        stuff sorted out soon. The later half of the show begins inter-connected some scenes to make more sense and does not
        follow back most of the formula setup by the previous episodes which is great, particularly the whole wondering
        in an infinite tatami room and peeking to his other self.

        I'm actually not sure how to properly interpret the show, since I only ever had 1 watching of it. And I'm sure I missed 
        a ton of stuff along the way. But from my view, the show seems to put us into the MC's perspective of making demons 
        of others, blaming other people for what happened, dreaming and wishing other routes to be played out but 
        never acting on it and setting unreliable expectations on how things will pan out.

        For the OP, I like how they can show all the characters without actually spoiling
        much of anything. For the final episode I love how they swapped the ED and OP positions, 
        it's just a nice little twist to it.
