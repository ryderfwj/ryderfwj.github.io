          Jokes aside, this show is a rather wild and weird one, the start is strange and is a tad bit hard to get used
          to,
          but a couple episodes in, its barely a nuisance. The characters are fun, engaging, memorable in the
          show's sense and each have a different side to them. Ozu seriously looks like an garlic bulb with shark teeth,
          but has a loving side with Kohinata revealed at the end. Akashi being super cold to everyone but mc,
          and panics when a she see's a moth. Jougasaki looks like your generic handsome popular guy but has some nasty
          weird secrets.
          Ryuoko the mature pretty dentist lady that has a licking problem when drunk. I like how everyone has this side
          to em that some
          are shown early on while others are slowly expanded as each episode progresses.

          By the 3rd episode me and everyone's grandma can see how this show will play out, keep rewinding back
          and repeat the whole process again with slightly different conditions. They still keep some minor things
          consistent, like how Ozu looks like an onion bulb, Akashi being in the engineering department and
          <s>hates</s> is midly inconvenienced by moths. I like how each episode introduced a new character or
          factions and gradually uses those new characters in order to differ each episode, whether by expanding
          the background of said character/faction or putting the mc in those positions like with the secret society.

          The story is certainly interesting. Repeating the same start with different choices that ultimate lead to an
          end
          where the MC just wishes to rewind every single time. It's sorta predictable but also adds enough variety
          in between all of it to make me think how this will play out differently. And I like how each time the cost of
          the fortune teller increases, as if saying its going to cost the MC more the longer the MC does not get his
          stuff sorted out soon. The later half of the show begins inter-connected some scenes to make more sense and
          does not
          follow back most of the formula setup by the previous episodes which is great, particularly the whole
          wondering
          in an infinite tatami room and peeking to his other self.

          I'm actually not sure how to properly interpret the show, since I only ever had 1 watching of it. And I'm sure
          I missed
          a ton of stuff along the way. But from my view, the show seems to put us into the MC's perspective of making
          demons
          of others, blaming other people for what happened, dreaming and wishing other routes to be played out but
          never acting on it and setting unreliable expectations on how things will pan out. It's relatable to alot of
          people in
          some way or form I'm sure. But the show manages to do show in an interesting way without bearing it down too
          heavily,
          at least that how I felt.

          For the OP, I like how they can show all the characters without actually spoiling
          much of anything. For the final episode I love how they swapped the ED and OP positions,
          it's just a nice little twist to it.

          For the "sequel" movie, almost everything is improved, the colors are vibrant and the production is just
          amazing
          and I enjoyed how fun it was during it's run time. And the animation is just phenomenal. It teaches how life
          is short and
          people should enjoy it as much as possible, a simple theme but one that fits the movie.
          The entire felt like going through several arcs already but actually all of it just happened within 1 night.
          Using back some concept from the main series and intergrating with new characters, the show
          manages to keep it fresh and unpredictable. And the focus on romance if only a little makes it a slightly
          different experience
          from the main series. The characters are fun but not as comparable to the ones in Tatami Galaxy. Still, it's a
          great movie to watch.
