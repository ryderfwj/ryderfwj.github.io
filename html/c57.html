        This show, visually opens up is an amazing manner, the colours, the celebratory music, the chaos and confusion.
        It is loud, it is noisy, it is very painful for my eyes while watching in a dark room at 2am, when considering the opening was just brown all the way. 
        So, note to self, don’t watch it in a dark room. On a serious note, the choice of using unmoving plaid was very interesting in my opinion. 
        The show was certainly eye catching with the visual style I so rarely see, but in some scenes, it doesn’t do too well, especially in darker areas, but that’s few and far between. 
        I would say the style might be its biggest hurdle of the show in you’re not into it until the Count show’s up.

        Besides which, the show hosts a rather large cast but manages to balance it in a rather great way, at least for my case. 
        Dividing the cast into 3 major families, the Count’s group and then other characters make it easier to remember them. 
        But the visual style also aids in that.

        The Morcerfs, are what I consider the most normal looking rich peeps, with a pretty normal house style and clothing other than Fernand who has a military uniform style due to his position.
        The Vilefort has this gloomy house setting where everything in the house is plain and muddy, a very uninteresting environment much like law, hearts don’t kill me. 
        The Danglars is just pure cash money with how extravagant it is and how Julian mostly dresses in gold when in the house. 
        And with the Count himself being the 2 extremes, for the most part, dark and gloomy in the newly bought mansion and certain parts of his ship, 
        while the underground mansion makes the Danglars one look like a chocolate bar.

        But that's a far as it goes, the setting is certainly interesting, literally just adding space element to the original story it was based upon. 
        It doesn’t change much really, but it does make every seem bigger and on a grander scale, even if the show didn’t use it to it fullest extent. 
        However, it does make every funky thing more believable, and allow the show to use more impressive concepts such at floating fortresses and mecha knights.
        Though the CGI execution is super dated in 2020, but I can't hate mecha.

        For the character aspect, the Count steals the spotlight every time he is in frame of the show. His voice (JP) is perfect for the role. 
        I was pulled in seeing him on screen and wondering what is he going to do next and how that particular action will play out and further into his overall plan. 
        I like how puts up a kind a charismatic face while secretly wants to be cold towards everything and he remains stone cold up till the end, 
        willing to do anything in order to get his revenge even harming or killing innocent people that just so happens to stand in his way. 
        I believe he did care for some people, mainly his group, Mercedes and Albert but losing his feeling over time made it hard and next to impossible by the end. 
        And the mystery surrounding him, his origin and the power he has only adds to my interest in him throughout the series.

        Albert, started off as annoying, naïve and reckless. 
        He just wouldn’t stop trusting the Count and keeps hanging out with him even though on a few occasions he should base on what happened, 
        but I suppose that is normal given he’s 15 years old, too which I learned so late into the show. 
        Like seriously, I thought we was already an adult or about 17 years old. Regardless, he’s what I see when you take the innocents and kindness of a person and leave it unchanged no matter what. 
        I’m sure most people with a decent enough past can relate to it at some point but time slowly changed us to be less trusting and more cautious as we grow to adulthood, 
        Albert is basically that minus the latter half part, wishing to believe that everyone (mostly everyone) is kind and good.

        And for Franz, I just need to give a shout out to this bro. What a great friend he is to Albert. 
        And I like how he is shown and presented. Not in a bratty full of himself person unlike another blonde twat, but a person who just wants his friend to be happy, or how he is gay, maybe gay? 
        Maybe… the shown doesn’t glance over it, but doesn’t linger on it either, 
        it just shown what are his motivation is behind what he is doing and respects it without making fun of it or trying to make it awkward. 
        And his final advice for Albert, his self-sacrifice, not wanting him to stop loving people and his message of love and hate steaming from love got to me.

        It’s also good to see the next generation not be as cruel and savage as their parents, for the most part. 
        Maximillian being a stand-up soldier and doesn’t back down on aristocracy but also is able to change his stubbornness later on after given some time. 
        Him coming back to thank Albert was a really great scene that show he appreciate his friendship with Albert and the others. 
        Eugenie playing the piano for herself and for Albert. And although her opera performance was staged for the most part. 
        The offer to further her skills was not, or at least that’s what it seemed to me. 
        And after everything that’s happened, she continues to chase her dreams, and not gives everything up to fall in love with the mc.

        My final thoughts on the show we're that I enjoy it very much, the mystery behind the Count kept me thinking and wanting more.
        The character interactions were both fuck you bastard, to this is some good bromance, plenty of variety and pleasing to see.
        Thank you for choosing this show, Zinz
