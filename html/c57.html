    <p>The show opens up in a stunning, loud and colourful atmosphere. It is loud, it is noisy, it is very painful for my eyes while watching in a dark room at 2am, when considering the opening was just brown all the way. So, note to self, don’t watch it in a dark room. On a serious note, the choice of using unmoving plaid was very interesting in my opinion. The show was certainly eye catching with the visual style I so rarely see, but in some scenes, it doesn’t do too well, especially in darker areas, but that’s few and far between. I would say the style might be its biggest hurdle of the show in you’re not into it until the Count show’s up.</p>
