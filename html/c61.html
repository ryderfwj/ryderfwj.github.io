        The show is great, the initial focus on comedy and “light” drama makes it easy to go into the show, 
        provided you’re not trying to figure out the plot or Japanese lore as others have stated. 
        The latter half has a more intertwined storyline and is where it show’s Sasami’s growth from an indoor shut-in neet so it does do things differently.

        I like Sasami, I genuinely do, someone who initially seem to wants to abandon all her duties and 
        just wants to live a carefree life isn’t exactly the best kind of role model nor someone to be respected for, but through plot development, 
        it’s shown she actually has thought through that and decided to place more faith in humanity to resolve their own problems. 
        And that is something not everyone can have, am I right doomers? And seeing her slowly grow over the episodes, making freinds along the way was pretty pog.

        The Yagami sisters are the fun part of the show I would, whenever they are involved, you can expect some sakuga and funny scenes. 
        Kagami is my favourite, <s>totally not because of my mecha bias</s> and the way she goes tee hee is cute. 
        But really now, the reason is because of episode 5. The latter half of the episode and her singing the ED out of sync was just great. 
        Not to mention seeing her go full depressed in a bunny suit because Sasami can’t go for the trip make her so precious.

        Tsurugi being a god that is just tired of protecting the world is certainly new to me, but I enjoy her the most when she takes over and 
        directs Sasami on the right part, showing that she is still capable and still cares. Also, whenever she goes full pervert mode, and her laugh is so cheecky. 
        Tama being a godeater? Is that the right term? was certainly surprising. Despite being a 10-year-old at heart, she has pretty strong knowledge on stuff, 
        like know friendship between godly being are real and she remains super positive and caring throughout the show.

        The OP is pretty awesome, and the ED being sung by each character in a horrible way and finally sung properly for the last time was pretty wholesome and 
        a great way for making me stick with the ED itself. The insert ost is pretty good too, the strong moments elevated by it.
        Overall, a nice show to watch, although pretty weird but in a good way, characters are the main focus along with good tracks and some pretty strong scenes.
