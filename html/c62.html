        Did you know over 1/4 of this show takes part in a desert? And I don't like...

        I love this show's casual scene with everyone just enjoying themselves and the mystery of the world itself, more on that later.
        The kids aren't super annoying and the way they act and eventually warm up to Willem was cute.
        And the casual interactions of the characters did it for me, like with Nygglatho wanting to eat Willem, 
        Tiat expalining everything about the city during her checkup and Willem explaining the effect of each shard when tuning the dug weapons.

        And our main duo here. Chtholly is so precious, seeing her care for the other kids while being a kid herself was pretty funny,
        like seeing her do dumb things like not eating sweet cuz bad examples. Regardless, I like that she's being very endearing, always trying her best 
        and her wanting to improve herself to be a good wife as well as distract herself from the almost impending doom. And seeing her wanting to live 
        and find happiness is such a good moment.

        Willem being the almost always cool guy is also pretty great. The way he tries to warm up to the kids by cooking sweet stuff and 
        doesnt try to step into a combat situation unless really neccessary is something I can appreciate. I've seen way too many mc step into situations other can
        handle properly way too many times. And he's pretty friendly too and seeing him getting jealous and frustrated about his romance on the ship was fun as well.
        Him trying to make the kids happy is such a father move.

        The side and supporting characters are great too. I really wasn't expecting Ithea to have such an interesting backstory trying to hide that she's
        a different person. Tiat being a bookworm for the movies and the island of Corna di Luce, what a nerd, but also protecc.
        Not only that, I like how Souwong still semi acts like a kid despite looking like one of those super strict, willing to do anything
        type of archmage, which is also kind of semi true given his willingness to create and use self-destructive humanoid fairies. 
        And I like the comedy of Ebon with Willem when they first met. Nice to see a great sense of humor from the show for what
        should be a more rivalry scene.

        And the world is quite interesting as well, it's nice to see how each island can have their unique cultures. And then there is the past.
        From the story of the full fight of humans vs the 3 gods, to the aftermath of the war and the rise 17 beasts,
        to how the process to lift all the islands up, the show is quite good at giving just enough for it to tell a story,
        but also keep a lot of things hidden to be expanded upon later down the line.

        Overall, lovely show to watch, the names can be a bit hard to pronounce and remember though and I'm not just referring to the title.
        Character interaction and world building are the show's strong points that I enjoyed very much, ty Genxun for picking this.
