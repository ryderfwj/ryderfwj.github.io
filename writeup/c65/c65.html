            So first. Sound, sound, sound, overall solid. The gun sounds, the hits, the reloads, the explosions, solid. The ships, from the thrusters to the internal ambience, solid. Nothing increadible from those parts, but the voice acting. Oh the voice acting is just absolute perfection. I watched the dub, so I can't comment on the JP VA, but the dub is the best I've ever heard, hands down no contest. I take time getting used to dubs, even good ones like TTGL, but for Bebop, it was just instantly yep, this was they way it's meant to be heard. The OP and ED are just as good, I've only really ever heard praise to the OP because it's so iconic at this point and I can say that it met the hype. The ED although I won't say it's the OP tier, but it definitely holds up. Getting fired up by the OP and slowly winding down with the ED.

            The art and animation is incredible for Bebop as well. The artstyle is very gritty and yet managed to fit the show's aesthetics so well. And the animation quality for the majority of the show is good and in the off hand chance we get hand to hand combat it becomes superb, the lighting and shine on the ships is superb. It doesn't matter if it's an important episode or just a silly adventure one, the production values are so fucking good. And this shit was 20 years ago, it still holds up against some of the top anime currently, fantastic.

            The cast of Bebop is great and I can safely say I will remember them pretty well years from now <s>unless I get a frying pan to my head</s>. The main cast all compliment each other well when the situation they're in demands it, but that is not to say they work well willingly which is where a lot of the comedies comes from. Spike and Jet's relationship is the best for me, you can tell there is a deep friendship between them but it's not the "I am your nakama" kind, they're adults and saying it out loud like that is kinda cringe anyways. The way Jet let Spike back to the ship after the argument they had before going to the snow planet and how they try to cover for each other and support each other throughout the show, it's really nice to see. Individually, the cast is flawed, but that's initally, as each episode passed, more and more are revealed from the adventures they had, and all of them have especially heavy emphasis on their past with the exception of Ed and Ein. And speaking of Ed and Ein, them leaving was just a sad moment, they even used the damn dog whimper, my feels. I will say individually, I like Jet because he's like a father figure of the ship and cares for everyone on his ship, I like Spike because of his chill and cool attitude for the most part but can snap at people in 2 way <s>see vicious and andy</s>, I like Faye because of how badass she is and how her memories dramatically changed her behaviour for a while, I like Ed because of how fucking weird of a genius hacker she is and I like Ein because they actually used the data dog plot for something.

            So by the time I finished Bebop, I can only sum it in a vague way, more on that later. For other shows, you can sum the plot relatively easy, well and accurate and it generally encompasses the whole show. Sword Art Online [<s>rape fest, harem, abridge is better</s> Trapped in an MMO] | Re:Creators [Trapped in real life] | Yamato 2199 [Space Journey to save Earth] | Naruto [To become Hokage] | IBO [To reach the dream <s>pepecry</s>]. For those shows, there's a final goal or place where the anime will try to reach and that goes for most other shows too. But for Bebop I can only sum it up as [Space Adventure], there's no clear goal for the show, the "plot" was basically just another adventure, I can definitely say, it's all about Spike but that would not even cover more than half of the show. In light of that, I realize it's fine, I love episodic shows, some of my favourite shows are episodic, Yuru Camp and Flying Witch. And to that, I can consider Bebop as a technical slice of life, the only major difference to normal slice of life shows is that normal life involves lots of violence. <s>Wow all that and you come up with the conclusion that it's a slide of life? Really?</s>
